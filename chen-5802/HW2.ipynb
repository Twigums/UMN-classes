An outlier is defined as an \"observation which deviates so much from other observations as to arouse suspicion it was generated by a different mechanism\" ([Hawkins, 1980](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-94-015-3994-4)). Identifying outliers can be very difficult for complex data.\n","\n","There are two general types of approaches:\n","\n","* **parametric**: Assume a form of the underlying distribution, then remove data that have a sufficiently low probability of occuring given that distribution.\n","\n","* **non-parameteric**: Use distance metrics to identify points that are very far away from others.\n","\n","### z-score for univariate normally distributed data (parametric)\n","\n","The simplest case of outlier detection is to look for outliers in a 1-dimensional dataset that follows a normal distribution. This is typically done using a z-score:\n","\n","$z_i = |\\frac{x_i-\\mu}{\\sigma}|$\n","\n","where $x_i$ is the data point, $\\mu$ is the mean of the normal distribution, and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation. This essentially tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean a data point is. Then, we can apply a cutoff, typically $z=3$, and drop any data that is outside the cutoff. A cutoff of $z=3$ is chosen since this corresponds to 99.7% of the data, so assuming the data actually follows the presumed normal distribution we would only risk discarding 0.03% of real data points.\n","\n","### Euclidean distance for arbitrarily distributed data (non-parametric)\n","\n","The distance of a point from the center of the collected data is another metric for outlier detection. For example, we could calculate the center of a 1d array as the median of that array. Each point in the array could be categorized by a distance from the median. E.g., if I have an array of data [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12], the median = 4, so the distances from the median = [3, 3, 1, 0, 1, 6, 8], meaning the last point in my array is the most extreme. This type of approach can be used for outlier detection by specifying a distance cutoff (e.g., all points that are > 10 from the median are outliers).\n","\n","**Note**: [Mahalanobis distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance) is a similarly spirited but generally more useful approach that Euclidean distance. You can also compute this with python (e.g., see [`scipy.spatial.distance.mahalanobis`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.mahalanobis.html)), but it's more involved than Euclidean distances so this assignment focuses just on Euclidean distances.\n","\n","## Follow the steps below to apply parametric and non-parametric outlier detection
